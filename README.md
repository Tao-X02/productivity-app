# Productivity-App

Built a full-stack productivity app that allows users to sign up, log in, and track their daily tasks, with the ability to add, delete, edit, and track their progress with a stopwatch timer. 

Developed with the MERN stack:

  - **Express**
  - **React**
  - **Node**

Additional technologies include:
  - **Redux**
  - **JWT** (JSON Web Token)
  - **BCrypt**
  - **Bootstrap**
  - **Mocha** and **Chai** (unit tests for backend)
  - **Heroku** (backend deployment)

Use the following commands to run the app

```
cd client
